- A 25*25 domain.
- Here are the different colors meaning:
    - White: Free spaces
    - Black: Walls
    - Yellow: Golds
    - Red: An agent which is not carrying a gold
    - Green: An agent which is carrying a gold
    - Transparent pink: Storage

- In this animation the agent just pich a random action.
- This animation is the result of test on the Domain class. 
- The following actions might be attempted by the agent, however, will be denied:
    - going out of the domain
    - going into a wall
    - trying to pick up gold, while there is no gold
